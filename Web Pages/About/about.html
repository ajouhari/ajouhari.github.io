                <p>To be able to achieve momentous tasks using only a computer with an internet connection is an ability I never take for granted. 
                    But It wouldn’t be possible without the great minds that preceded us. Those that were never satisfied with the status quo. 
                    Those that kept pushing for greater things. Those that invent, then reinvent themselves. Those that made the world a better 
                    place. To them, I am thankful, and I hope to give back to mankind as they have done. <br><br>
                    But how does one even go about making the world a better place? Well, think about all the times you were navigating the web 
                    or using an application, and it took a long time to load, or even worse, it suddenly crashed. The world would be a better 
                    place if we didn’t have to deal with that. <br><br>
                    Nobody likes code that breaks or has an extremely long runtime. But that’s the harsh reality we have to face. There’s tons of 
                    bad code all over the internet. That’s where I come in to fix it. I write my code to perfection, producing programs that won’t 
                    break and with a runtime that is efficient as possible. <br><br>
                    Although I prefer the <strong>Python</strong> programming language, I also have experience with the following: <strong>JavaScript, Java, HTML5, CSS.</strong> 
                    As well as experience with the following frameworks: <strong>GitHub, Unity.</strong>
